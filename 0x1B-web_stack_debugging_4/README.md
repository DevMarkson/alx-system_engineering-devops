# Web Stack Debugging - Readme

This readme document provides an overview of the web stack debugging task aimed at improving the performance and functionality of our web server setup featuring Nginx. The task involves resolving the issue of a high number of failed requests and addressing an OS configuration problem related to user login and file access.

## Issue Description

Our web server setup is currently experiencing a significant number of failed requests. The initial benchmarking using ApacheBench, a widely-used tool in the industry, revealed that out of 2000 requests made to the server with 100 requests at a time, 943 requests failed. This high failure rate indicates a problem with our web stack configuration that needs to be addressed.

Additionally, there is an issue with the OS configuration, specifically related to the "holberton" user. Currently, logging in with this user and attempting to open a file results in error messages. To ensure smooth user login and file access without encountering any errors, changes need to be made to the OS configuration.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this debugging task are as follows:

1. Resolve the issue of a high number of failed requests by optimizing our web stack configuration. By fine-tuning the settings, we aim to reduce the failure rate to zero. Detailed logs will be crucial in identifying and addressing the root cause of the problem.

2. Modify the OS configuration to enable successful login with the "holberton" user and ensure error-free file access. This requires updating the necessary settings to eliminate any error messages that occur during user login or when attempting to open files.

## Action Steps

To address the above-mentioned issues, the following steps should be taken:

1. Analyze Logs: Thoroughly examine the logs related to the failed requests to gain insights into the specific errors or patterns causing the failures. Logs play a crucial role in identifying the underlying issues and can guide us towards the appropriate solution.

2. Optimize Web Stack Configuration: Based on the analysis of the logs, make necessary adjustments to our web stack configuration, particularly focusing on Nginx settings. By fine-tuning parameters such as concurrency limits, timeouts, and request handling, we can improve the server's ability to handle incoming requests and reduce the failure rate.

3. Benchmark Testing: After implementing the configuration changes, conduct benchmark testing using ApacheBench or similar tools to verify the improvements. Make adjustments as necessary and repeat the testing until the failure rate reaches zero.

4. Update OS Configuration: Modify the OS configuration to enable smooth login with the "holberton" user and error-free file access. This may involve updating security limits or permissions related to the user and file system settings. Thoroughly test the changes to ensure they are effective and eliminate any error messages.

5. Documentation: Document the changes made to the web stack configuration and OS settings, providing clear instructions and explanations for future reference. Include any important findings, troubleshooting steps, and insights gained throughout the debugging process.

By following these steps, we aim to optimize our web server setup, resolve the high number of failed requests, and ensure seamless user login and file access within our system.
