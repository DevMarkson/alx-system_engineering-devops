Sure, here's an example of a `README.md` file that could accompany the code:

# Fixing Typo in wp-settings.php

This code fixes a typo in the `wp-settings.php` file in a WordPress installation. The incorrect filename 'class-wp-locale.phpp' is replaced with the correct filename 'class-wp-locale.php'.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Open the file `fix-typo.php` in a text editor.
2. Update the `$file_path` variable to the correct path of the `wp-settings.php` file.
3. Run the code by executing the `php fix-typo.php` command in the terminal.

## Requirements

- PHP must be installed on the system.
- The `sed` command must be available on the system.

## Assumptions

This code assumes the following:

- The file path specified in the `$file_path` variable is correct.
- The incorrect filename 'class-wp-locale.phpp' exists in the `wp-settings.php` file.
- The corrected filename 'class-wp-locale.php' is the intended replacement for the incorrect filename.
