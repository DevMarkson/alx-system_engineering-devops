# This code replaces the old value "phpp" with the new value "php" in the wp-settings.php file of the WordPress installation located at /var/www/html/. It does this using the sed command, which is run as a sudo command with the necessary permissions. By using clearer variable names, this code becomes easier to read and maintain in the long run.

exec { 'replace-wordpress-phpp-with-php':
  environment => ['DIRECTORY=/var/www/html/wp-settings.php',
                  'OLD_VALUE=phpp',

  path        => ['/usr/bin', '/bin'],
  returns     => [0, 1]
